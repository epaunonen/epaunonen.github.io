### NFL Analysis

[View Dashboard](https://app.powerbi.com/view?r=eyJrIjoiYmMyYWY2ZjgtNGM1ZC00ZGVjLWFhODMtYTY5OTM0N2I1YmJmIiwidCI6IjhkZWQ3ODVjLTJiYTYtNGIxYS05NmUyLWY3NGFiZTk2MWFiZCIsImMiOjh9)

<p>This dashboard offers functionality for comparing NFL team performance and play type (e.g. running play, passing play) likelihood and yard gains.<br>
Additionally, it allows for a detailed view of any NFL game from 1999 to present day.<br>
Functionality for predicting the outcome of a single play with full parameter control is planned, but not yet at a working state.<br>
<br>
This project uses data provided by [nflfastR](https://www.nflfastr.com/index.html), a R package for obtaining NFL play-by-play data.<br>
At the moment, a NoSQL database is built and updated locally by the package and afterwards the dashboard is refreshed with the updated data.<br>
